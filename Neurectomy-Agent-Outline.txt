💡 Pro Tips for Using Agents with NEURECTOMY
Context Loading: Always open relevant NEURECTOMY files before invoking agents so they have context
Multi-Agent Synergy: Use 2-3 agents together for complex tasks (e.g., @ARCHITECT @APEX @SYNAPSE)
Iterative Refinement: Start with @ARCHITECT for design, then @APEX for implementation
Security First: Always include @CIPHER or @FORTRESS when dealing with auth or data handling
Documentation Parallel: Keep @SCRIBE involved throughout to maintain documentation
This action plan provides a structured approach to executing NEURECTOMY Phase 1 while leveraging the specialized capabilities of each Elite Agent. The agents are specifically matched to tasks where their expertise will provide maximum value.
