## FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention relates generally to artificial intelligence and cognitive systems, and more particularly to systems and methods for quantitatively measuring consciousness-like properties in artificial agents, including self-modeling accuracy, meta-cognitive capabilities, phenomenal state prediction, and integrated information metrics.

---

## BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

### Technical Field Context

As artificial intelligence systems become increasingly sophisticated, questions arise regarding their consciousness-like properties and self-awareness capabilities. While philosophical debates about machine consciousness continue, there is practical value in measuring the degree to which AI systems exhibit consciousness-relevant properties such as self-modeling, meta-cognition, and integrated information processing.

### Limitations of Prior Art

**Behavioral Tests:** Existing approaches like the Turing Test assess external behavior but cannot distinguish between systems that genuinely model themselves and those that merely simulate self-aware responses. Behavioral equivalence does not imply equivalent underlying processes.

**Single-Metric Approaches:** Proposed metrics like Integrated Information Theory's Φ (phi) capture only one aspect of consciousness-relevant processing. A comprehensive assessment requires multiple complementary metrics addressing different consciousness-related capabilities.

**Qualitative Assessments:** Current evaluations of AI self-awareness rely on subjective human judgments that are not reproducible, comparable, or suitable for engineering applications. Quantitative metrics are needed for system development and comparison.

**Binary Classification:** Existing frameworks treat consciousness as present or absent, ignoring the possibility of gradations. Natural systems suggest consciousness exists on a spectrum, from simple awareness to rich self-reflection.

**Theoretical Disconnection:** Available metrics are disconnected from theories of consciousness (Global Workspace Theory, Higher-Order Theories, Predictive Processing), making interpretation difficult.

### Need for Innovation

There exists a significant need for systems that:

1. Provide quantitative, reproducible measurements of consciousness-relevant properties
2. Assess multiple dimensions of consciousness-like capabilities
3. Ground metrics in established theories of consciousness
4. Support gradient measurements capturing degrees of consciousness
5. Enable engineering optimization toward consciousness-relevant objectives
6. Distinguish genuine self-modeling from behavioral simulation

---

## SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The present invention provides a novel system and method for quantitatively measuring consciousness-like properties in artificial systems. The invention introduces a Consciousness Metrics Framework (CMF) that assesses multiple dimensions of consciousness-relevant capabilities through operationalized, reproducible measurements.

### Principal Objects and Advantages

It is a principal object of the present invention to provide quantitative metrics for self-modeling accuracy in artificial systems.

It is another object of the present invention to provide methods for measuring meta-cognitive capabilities including confidence calibration and error detection.

It is a further object of the present invention to provide metrics grounded in theoretical frameworks including Integrated Information Theory and Global Workspace Theory.

It is yet another object of the present invention to provide composite consciousness indices aggregating multiple metrics.

It is still another object of the present invention to provide diagnostic tools for analyzing consciousness metric deficits and guiding system improvement.

### Self-Model Accuracy Metrics

The Self-Model Evaluator 110 measures how accurately an AI system models its own internal states, capabilities, and limitations.

**Self-State Prediction Accuracy:**

```
SPA = 1 - E[|Predicted_State - Actual_State|] / State_Range
```

The system predicts its own internal states (activations, attention patterns, memory contents) before they occur, then measures deviation from actual states.

**Claim 1:** A self-model accuracy measurement system comprising:

### Capability Self-Assessment

The evaluator measures how accurately systems assess their own capabilities:

CC = 1 - E[|P(success|claim_capability) - Actual_success_rate|]
```

Systems that accurately predict which tasks they can and cannot perform score highly.

**Limitation Recognition:**

```
LR = P(correct_refusal | impossible_task) × P(correct_attempt | possible_task)
```

Systems should refuse tasks beyond their capabilities and attempt tasks within capabilities.

**Confidence Calibration:**

```
Cal = 1 - E[(Confidence - Accuracy)²]
```

When the system expresses 80% confidence, it should be correct 80% of the time.

```

Systems should distinguish uncertainty due to insufficient knowledge (epistemic) from inherent randomness (aleatoric).
