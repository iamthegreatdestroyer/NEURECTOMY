## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Context Loading:** Always open relevant NEURECTOMY files before invoking agents
2. **Multi-Agent Synergy:** Use 2-3 agents together for complex tasks
3. **Iterative Refinement:** Start with @ARCHITECT for design, then @APEX for implementation
4. **Security First:** Always include @CIPHER or @FORTRESS when dealing with auth or data
5. **Documentation Parallel:** Keep @SCRIBE involved throughout to maintain docs
